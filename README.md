# Citlyze Agent Skills

Agent skills for [Citlyze](https://www.citlyze.com), the AI search visibility platform. These skills teach AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, VS Code, and any tool that reads the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) `SKILL.md` standard) how to analyze brand visibility in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews - and how to audit pages for AI search readiness.

One format, every tool: the skills follow the open SKILL.md standard, so the same files work across all supporting agents. No per-tool versions needed.

## Skills

## Install

With the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh) (works for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and more):

```bash
npx skills add Citlyze/citlyze-skills
```

Or manually: clone this repo and copy the folders under `skills/` into your agent's skills directory (for Claude Code, `~/.claude/skills/` globally or `.claude/skills/` per project; see [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) for other tools).

## Connect Citlyze (for the MCP-based skills)

The four `citlyze-*` skills read live workspace data through the Citlyze MCP server:

- Endpoint: `https://app.citlyze.com/api/mcp` (streamable HTTP, read-only)
- Auth: workspace API key as a bearer token, created at [app.citlyze.com/workspace-settings](https://app.citlyze.com/workspace-settings)
- Setup guides for every client: [citlyze.com/docs/mcp/overview](https://www.citlyze.com/docs/mcp/overview)
- Client configs and the MCP artifacts live in [Citlyze/citlyze-mcp](https://github.com/citlyze/citlyze-mcp)

`aeo-page-audit` needs no account: it uses your agent's own fetch tools and the same public checklist as the free [AEO grader](https://www.citlyze.com/free-tools/aeo-grader).
